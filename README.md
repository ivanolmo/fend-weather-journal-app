# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## My Work
I changed the page styling from the base project that was given to give it a more 'weather related' look, though the changes were very basic.
I also made some minor changes to add in the city name when calling the weather data.
